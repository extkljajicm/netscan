# SECURITY NOTE: Sensitive credentials are loaded from a separate .env file
# for enhanced security. The .env file is created during deployment with
# restrictive permissions (600) and contains default test values that match
# docker-compose.yml. For production use, update the .env file with secure
# credentials.
#
# Required environment variables in .env file:
# - INFLUXDB_TOKEN=netscan-token (default for testing)
# - INFLUXDB_ORG=test-org (default for testing)
# - SNMP_COMMUNITY=public (default for testing - change for production security)
#
# DO NOT store actual credentials in this config.yml file!
