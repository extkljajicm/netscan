# Changelog

All notable changes to netscan will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Performance optimization for high-resource hardware**: Updated default configuration values to support large-scale deployments
  - `icmp_workers`: 64 → 1024 (16x increase for faster discovery scans on high-performance servers)
  - `snmp_workers`: 32 → 256 (8x increase for better concurrent SNMP polling)
  - `max_devices`: 10000 → 20000 (2x increase to support larger networks)
  - `max_concurrent_pingers`: 1000 → 20000 (20x increase to match device capacity)
  - `memory_limit_mb`: 512 → 16384 (32x increase for 16GB RAM servers)
  - `influxdb.batch_size`: 100 → 5000 (50x increase for better write throughput)
  - Updated validation limits: `icmp_workers` max 2000, `snmp_workers` max 1000, `max_devices` max 100000, `max_concurrent_pingers` max 100000, `memory_limit_mb` max 16384
  - **Rationale**: Balanced configuration optimizes for high-performance servers (8+ cores, 16GB+ RAM) while controlling ICMP packet rates
  - **Backward compatibility**: Existing config files work unchanged; values remain fully configurable for smaller deployments
  - Documentation updated in README.md and MANUAL.md with deployment size guidelines

### Added

- Health metrics persistence: New decoupled service to periodically write application health metrics to separate InfluxDB bucket
  - New configuration parameters: `influxdb.health_bucket` (default: "health") and `health_report_interval` (default: "10s")
  - New Ticker 5: Health Report Loop writes metrics every 10 seconds by default
  - Dual-bucket architecture in InfluxDB writer with separate WriteAPI for health metrics
  - New measurement `health_metrics` with fields: device_count, active_pingers, goroutines, memory_mb, influxdb_ok, influxdb_successful_batches, influxdb_failed_batches
  - Refactored health server to expose public `GetHealthMetrics()` method for reusability
  - Full backward compatibility: existing config files work without changes (defaults applied)

### Summary

netscan is a Go network monitoring service (Go 1.25+) targeting linux-amd64 exclusively. The application implements a decoupled, multi-ticker architecture for efficient network device discovery and continuous monitoring.

### Core Features

**Multi-Ticker Architecture**
- Five independent concurrent event loops orchestrated in main.go
- ICMP Discovery Ticker: Finds new devices via ping sweeps (configurable interval, default 5m)
- Daily SNMP Scan Ticker: Enriches all devices with metadata at scheduled time (e.g., 02:00)
- Pinger Reconciliation Ticker: Ensures all devices have active monitoring goroutines (every 5s)
- State Pruning Ticker: Removes stale devices (every 1h, 24h threshold)
- Health Report Ticker: Writes health metrics to InfluxDB (configurable interval, default 10s)

**Discovery & Monitoring**
- Concurrent ICMP discovery with configurable worker pools (default: 64 workers)
- Concurrent SNMP scanning with worker pools (default: 32 workers)
- Continuous per-device ping monitoring (dedicated goroutine per device, default: 2s interval)
- Dual-trigger SNMP: Immediate scan on discovery + scheduled daily scan for all devices
- SNMP robustness: GetNext fallback for device compatibility, handles both string and []byte OctetString types

**State Management**
- Thread-safe StateManager as single source of truth for all devices
- Device struct: IP, Hostname, SysDescr, LastSeen timestamp
- LRU eviction when max_devices limit reached (default: 10000)
- RWMutex protection for all operations
- Device metadata enrichment via SNMP

**Data Persistence**
- InfluxDB v2 time-series metrics storage
- Batching system (default: 100 points per batch, 5s flush interval)
- Background flusher goroutine with graceful shutdown
- Data sanitization and validation before writes
- Health check on startup (fail-fast if InfluxDB unavailable)

**Observability & Monitoring**
- HTTP health check server (default port: 8080)
- Three endpoints: /health (detailed JSON), /health/ready (readiness), /health/live (liveness)
- Docker HEALTHCHECK directive integration
- Health metrics: device count, active pingers, InfluxDB stats, memory, goroutines, uptime

**Logging**
- Structured logging with zerolog
- Machine-parseable JSON logs
- Colored console output for development
- Context-rich logging: IP addresses, device counts, durations, errors
- Log levels: Fatal, Error, Warn, Info, Debug

**Testing & Quality**
- Comprehensive test suite covering orchestration logic
- Race detection clean: all tests pass with -race flag
- Unit tests for all packages
- Performance benchmarks for regression detection

**Configuration**
- YAML configuration file with environment variable expansion (${VAR_NAME} syntax)
- CLI flag support: -config to specify custom config path
- Backward compatibility: optional discovery_interval field with sensible default
- Comprehensive validation on startup with clear error messages
- Resource protection: limits for devices, pingers, memory, scan intervals

**Deployment Options**
- Docker deployment (recommended): Multi-stage Dockerfile, ~15MB Alpine image, docker-compose.yml
- Native systemd deployment (alternative): Non-root service user, CAP_NET_RAW via setcap
- Automated deployment scripts: deploy.sh (install), undeploy.sh (cleanup)
- Docker verification script for CI/CD

**Security**
- IP address validation: prevents loopback, multicast, link-local, unspecified addresses
- SNMP string sanitization: removes null bytes, control characters, validates UTF-8
- Network range validation: prevents dangerous scans
- Docker: Runs as root (required for ICMP), container isolation provides security boundary
- Native: Runs as non-root service user with Linux capabilities
- Security scanning in CI/CD: govulncheck for Go, Trivy for Docker images

**Performance Optimizations**
- Lock-free batching via buffered channels
- Worker pool patterns for concurrent operations
- Streaming CIDR expansion (no intermediate arrays)
- Context-based cancellation for clean shutdown
- WaitGroup tracking for all goroutines
- Panic recovery on all goroutines
